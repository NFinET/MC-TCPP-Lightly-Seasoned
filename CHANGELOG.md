# CHANGELOG VERSION INFO
| MC VERSION | PACK VERSION |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1.19.3 | v3.1.1 |

# MODS ADDED
Mod Name | What the mod doin'?
--- | ---
Build Guide | Adds a configurable hotkey (set to "N" in this modpack) that allows you to project temporary building guide holograms of various shapes and modify the way they are sized and oriented.
Default Options (Fabric Edition) | Allows me to ship default hotkey configurations to players of the pack that won't override your existing hotkeys if you edited them from the modpack defaults.


# MODS REMOVED
Mod Name | Reason
--- | ---
DefaultSettings for Fabric | Wasn't completely working properly resulting in odd behavior when attempting to change some keybinds or options. Replacing it with Default Options (Fabric Edition) which has the same purpose.


# CONFIGURATION CHANGES

* Build Guide
  * Build Guide menu hotkey changed to "N", the default of the mod was "B" which conflicted with Xaero's Minimap hotkey for waypoints.
