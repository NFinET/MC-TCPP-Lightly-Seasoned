# CHANGELOG VERSION INFO
| MC VERSION | PACK VERSION |

| 1.19.3 | v3.2.1 |

# SPECIAL NOTES
## Litematica has been added to the pack!
* ## !!! PLEASE READ THIS SECTION IF YOU WANT TO USE OR LEARN LITEMATICA !!!
  * ### Litematica is a HIGHLY powerful building tool for saving, loading, and preview rendering designs to/from special schematic files. It's a highly complicated mod, and unless you think you need its features, you can safely ignore its existence entirely.
  * ### [Go HERE to the wiki page for Litematica in this modpack to read the keybind changes, a beginner tutorial, and other info!](https://github.com/NFinET/MC-TCPP-Lightly-Seasoned/wiki/Litematica-Important-Info)  

## The shader pack [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) has been added, and will be shipped with the pack by default from now on. It is a shader pack based on the BSL Shaders shader pack and is highly recommended.

# MODS ADDED
Mod Name | What the mod doin'?
--- | ---
Capes [Fabric/Forge] | Allows you to see and use capes from a handful of other mods that have their own capes such as Optifine, LabyMod, MinecraftCapes.net, Wynntils, Cosmetica, and Cloaks+. Only other people using this mod can see capes you add to yourself from it. If you want to make your own custom cape and don't know any of the listed mods, I recommend using [MinecraftCapes.net](https://minecraftcapes.net/) by linking your Microsoft account or making a throwaway account
LambDynamicLights | Allows you to see / use dynamic lights when holding items that create light, and works with or without shaders! Important to note, this light is only rendered and not "real", and thus doesn't count for lighting-based calculation mechanics, like spawning of mobs
Litematica | Adds an extremely in-depth and powerful schematic system, allowing you to save, load, and render schematic files to assist with building. This mod is VERY complex, and some changes were made to its keybinds. If you want to use this mod AT ALL, please see the wiki page dedicated to it [>>HERE<<](https://github.com/NFinET/MC-TCPP-Lightly-Seasoned/wiki/Litematica-Important-Info)
MaLiLib | API Library, depencency of Litematica
MidnightControls | Adds highly configurable and optional controller support
MidnightLib | API / Dependency, required for both MidnightControls and Puzzle
Model Gap Fix | Fixes a vanilla issue with the model renderer that causes weird gaps / seams in some 3D models and in held items
Neat (Fabric/Quilt) | Adds configurable floating unit panes above entities
Notes | Adds a configurable "Notes" menu with keybind, that allows you to keep notes within your game that can be per-world (save / server) or global, and pinned as a sidebar. For this modpack, the keybind is "J", as the mod's default had conflicts with other mods
Puzzle | Adds better GUI & configuration to graphics options

# CONFIGURATION CHANGES
* Notes (the mod)
  * Changed Notes keybind from "N" (which conflicted with the pack's keybind for Build Guide) to "J", think of it as "[J]ournal".

* Litematica
  * Generic
    *  "easyPlaceVanillaReach" set to "true"; (Reduces easyPlace reach from 6 to vanilla 4.5 so servers wonâ€™t reject far block placement)
  * Hotkeys
    *  Changed a LOT of keybinds that all used "M" as their main key, since that is already in use by Xaero's World Map. The "main key" for Litematica is now " . " (PERIOD). All default Litematica keybinds that used "M" in them have been changed to use " ." (PERIOD), but are otherwise exactly the same. Details on the keybinds can be found in the table below. Keybinds are listed in the order they appear in Litematica's "HOTKEYS" menu tab.
  *  Additionally added 1 new binding for "executeOperation", bound to PERIOD + U; this action was by default not bound to anything.  

Litematica Keybind | New Bind
--- | --- 
addSelectionBox | PERIOD + A
executeOperation | PERIOD + U 
layerModeNext | PERIOD + PAGE_UP
layerModePrevious | PERIOD + PAGE_DOWN
openGuiMainMenu | PERIOD
openGuiMaterialList | PERIOD + L
openGuiSchematicPlacements | PERIOD + P
openGuiSchematicVerifier | PERIOD + V
openGuiSelectionManager | PERIOD + S
openGuiSettings | PERIOD + C
pickBlockToggle | PERIOD + BUTTON_3 (Middle mouse)
rerenderSchematic | F3 + PERIOD
selectionModeCycle | LEFT_CONTROL + PERIOD
toggleAllRendering | PERIOD + R
toggleSchematicRendering | PERIOD + G
toolEnabledToggle | PERIOD + T  
  
* Neat (Fabric/Quilt)
  * Most of the changes for this mod were done to attempt to make it a bit less intrusive since it can make places with many mobs (such as farms) very chaotic with its default settings
  * "maxDistance" set to 16 (Default: 24); maximum distance that Neat entity panes are visible from; 
  * "heightAbove" set to 0.66 (Default: 0); height above the entity that the nameplate renders in blocks, the default rendered them partially inside mob's heads for some reason? This height puts it above them, and gives clearance for normal vanilla nametag plates
  * "backgroundPadding" set to 1 (Default: 2)
  * "backgroundHeight" set to 5 (Default: 6)
  * "barHeight" set to 3 (Default: 4)
  * "plateSize" set to 10 (Default: 25); size of the entity panes themselves, default felt a bit too large
  * "hpTextHeight" set to 12 (Default: 14)  
  
* Puzzle
  * Miscellaneous Settings
    * "Check for Updates" set to "No"
    * "Show Puzzle Version Info" set to "No"
